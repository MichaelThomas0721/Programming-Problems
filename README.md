# Programming-Problems
My solutions to programming problems that I try.

I am trying to learn more about algorithms, techniques, patterns, problem solving and maybe new languages!

Currently (July 10th 2023) I am trying to do 2 problems a day from neetcode 150 until I finish it to get a better understanding of data structures and algorithms.
Hopefully after completing it I will be able to do most problems within 10 minutes.
